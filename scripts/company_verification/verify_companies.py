"""Company data-verification pipeline for JTracker.

    python3 verify_companies.py                 # dry run against the live DB
    python3 verify_companies.py --snapshot DIR  # dry run against a backup
    python3 verify_companies.py --apply         # back up, apply, re-verify

What it guarantees once applied: every work mail domain maps to exactly one
company, and that company is the right one. How:

1. Resolve each contact's work domain to the domain its owner registers
   (`ny.email.gs.com` -> `gs.com`, `in.pwc.com` -> `pwc.com`).
2. Apply the verified rules in decisions.json: merges (duplicate rows, brands
   filed under a subdomain or a sibling TLD), renames, domain moves, typo
   domains, personal-mail buckets, junk rows.
3. Give every remaining registrable domain one owner (the company it is the
   main domain of) and move stray contacts to it. A company is folded into
   another only when all of its contacts move — never because one contact
   was misfiled.
4. Emit the plan, a report, and the domain -> company map; with --apply,
   execute the plan (contacts and tracked rows move before any company is
   deleted, because deleting a company cascades to its contacts and sends),
   then re-read the DB and re-check every invariant.
