"""Independent audit of what the pipeline changed: original snapshot vs now.

    python3 audit.py <original_backup_dir>            # vs the live DB
    python3 audit.py <original_backup_dir> <other>    # vs another backup

Deliberately shares no planning code with verify_companies.py / verify_names.py:
it only reads the two states and checks, row by row, that every difference is
one the rules allow. A bug in the pipeline's logic can't hide here by being
repeated.
