/// The signal is Gmail's own thread id, not a match on sender and time. Every

/// contact answering from their personal address, or a colleague picking up a
/// mail sent to `recruiting@`, is still detected. Matching inbound mail by
/// address would miss both, and would count a newsletter from the same address
/// as a reply.
///
/// Two passes, in order:
///
/// 1. **Recover.** Sends recorded before the app captured thread ids have none.
///    Their messages are still in Sent, and we know exactly who each one went to
///    and when, so a one-off search recovers the thread id — this is a lookup,
///    not a guess. It runs once per send and never again.
/// 2. **Check.** For every send that has a thread and no reply yet, read the
///    thread's headers and look for a message that isn't ours.
///
/// Like `MailQueue`, this holds no reference to the auth or data stores: it is
/// handed a `reader` closure by `RootView`, so the refresh token never leaves
/// `GmailAuthStore`.
